Final Project for MUMT203 - Introduction to Digital Audio - Fall 2021 - McGill University

This project explores the feasibility of performing additive sound synthesis on a STM32 microcontroller. First, we present microcontrollers, their uses, their features, and their capabilities. Then, we describe the techniques used for sounds synthesis using the additive method. Finally, we attempt to implement an additive synthesizer on a STM32 microcontroller. We describe the steps taken and the main design decisions, therefore contributing with a simple guide of how to implement additive sound synthesis on a STM32 microcontroller.
